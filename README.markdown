# !&# Themer

This module requires jQuery UI. Make sure you load a jQuery UI stylesheet in your theme that styles the Slider widget.

Add any web-ready images to your theme directory at MYTHEME/images/mocks. These files will be listed in a block provided by this module. Clicking on one of the images in the list will make the image popup in an overlay. The slider widget at the top left of the page adjusts the opacity.
